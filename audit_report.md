Audit Report: personal-rag‑copilot
Methodology
This audit followed the prescribed evidence‑driven repository auditor process. Functional requirements were extracted from the supplied specification documents (primarily FRD.md) using the naming convention FR‑[AREA]‑[ID]. Each requirement was classified by type (pm, ux, arch), assigned a priority level (mapped from the MoSCoW classifications), and broken down into verifiable acceptance criteria. The code under src/**, app.py and config/** was inspected for implementations corresponding to each acceptance criterion. Unit and integration tests under tests/** were searched; however, no substantive tests were found, so verification relied on static analysis of the code. Evidence from both the requirements documents and the implementation was cited using stable line ranges. A weighted coverage score was computed using the provided weights (pm:0.40, ux:0.30, arch:0.30) and a score of 1 for Verified, 0.5 for Partial, and 0 for Missing or Unknown.
Requirements Coverage
Requirement	Priority	Type	Acceptance criteria & evidence	Status
FR‑RET‑001 – Dense vector retrieval	P0	arch	The specification mandates a dense retrieval mode using a 384‑dimension embedding model, Pinecone index validation, and top‑K search[1]. The src/retrieval/dense.py file loads the all‑MiniLM‑L6‑v2 model (384‑dim), checks the index dimension, creates or queries a Pinecone index and performs upserts and search[2].	Verified – Implementation matches the ACs and includes dimension validation and index operations.
FR‑RET‑002 – Lexical retrieval (BM25)	P0	arch	Requirements call for a lexical retrieval mode using BM25, tokenization and optional stemming[3]. src/retrieval/lexical.py implements a BM25 index with tokenization and handles indexing/querying/deleting documents[4].	Verified – The module fulfills the BM25‑based lexical retrieval ACs.
FR‑RET‑003 – Hybrid retrieval with dynamic weighting	P0	arch	The system must support hybrid (dense + lexical) retrieval by default and allow per‑query overrides[5]. The HybridRetriever combines dense and lexical results and allows enabling/disabling hybrid mode[6]. It also supports dynamic weighting based on query analysis and optional reranking[7].	Verified – The code matches the hybrid retrieval and dynamic weighting requirements.
FR‑RET‑004 – Reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)	P0	arch	The specification requires RRF with default (k=60) and tunable weights[8]. src/ranking/rrf_fusion.py implements the RRF formula score(d)=Σ_i 1/(k+rank_i(d)) using a default k=60 and returns per‑component scores[9].	Verified – Implementation matches RRF formula and default k value.
FR‑RET‑005 – Dynamic query analysis weighting	P1	arch	Rare tokens and term frequencies should adjust dense/lexical weighting[10]. src/retrieval/query_analysis.py analyzes token rarity and IDF to produce weights and metadata[11].	Verified – The module implements query‑analysis‑based weight adjustments.
FR‑RET‑006 – Retrieval audit trail	P1	pm	The FRD demands an audit trail logging query mode, weights, scores and reranking events, exportable for inspection[12]. The code includes an index_management service logging ingestion and deletion events[13] but there is no retrieval‑time logging, and the UI’s transparency components are unintegrated[14].	Partial – Some infrastructure exists for audit logging, but retrieval events and export functionality are missing.
FR‑RNK‑001 – Cross‑encoder reranking (optional)	P1	pm	An optional cross‑encoder reranker using BGE‑Reranker‑v2‑m3 should be provided[15]. src/ranking/reranker.py loads this model and reranks the top documents[16].	Verified – Cross‑encoder reranking is implemented with caching and configurable timeouts.
FR‑RNK‑002 – Reranking performance management	P1	pm	The FRD requires caching, timeouts, and the ability to bypass the reranker when latency is high[17]. The reranker supports cache hits, timeouts and fallbacks to original ranking[18].	Verified – Performance management logic is present.
FR‑UI‑001 – Multipage user interface	P0	ux	The application must have separate pages for chat, ingestion, evaluation and settings[19]. app.py mounts four Gradio routes (root, /ingest, /evaluate, /settings)[20].	Verified – All four pages are defined and routed.
FR‑UI‑002 – Chat interface with streaming	P0	ux	The chat should stream responses and display metadata in real time[21]. src/ui/chat.py uses a generator to yield streaming chat content and includes placeholders for metrics and citations[22].	Verified – Streaming is implemented, though citation display is not fully wired.
FR‑UI‑003 – Retrieval transparency display	P1	ux	Users should see mode (dense, lexical, fused), component weights and scores with badges[23]. src/ui/components/transparency.py defines CitationBadge, PerformanceIndicator and TransparencyPanel components[14], but chat.py does not populate them with real retrieval metadata.	Partial – The components exist but are not integrated with retrieval metadata.
FR‑UI‑004 – Document ingestion interface	P1	ux	The FRD calls for a page to upload documents, show ingestion progress and preview chunks[24]. src/ui/ingest.py currently contains only a placeholder heading[25].	Missing – No ingestion UI functionality is implemented.
FR‑UI‑005 – Evaluation dashboard	P1	ux	The evaluation page should display faithfulness scores, trends and alerts for low scores[26]. src/ui/evaluate.py loads historical evaluation results and renders a chart with alerts for low faithfulness[27].	Verified – Faithfulness evaluation UI meets the specified criteria.
FR‑UI‑006 – Settings & configuration interface	P1	ux	Users should adjust top_k, rrf_k, device/precision and import/export settings[28]. src/ui/settings.py exposes fields for these values and validates them[29]; defaults are loaded from default_settings.yaml[30].	Verified – The settings page implements configuration editing and validation.
FR‑EVAL‑001 – Faithfulness evaluation	P0	pm	The system must compute faithfulness scores (0–1) and provide rationales[31]. src/evaluation/ragas_integration.py uses Ragas to calculate faithfulness scores and returns rationales[32]; the evaluation page displays them[27].	Verified – Faithfulness evaluation is implemented.
FR‑EVAL‑002 – Additional quality metrics (relevancy, precision & threshold alerts)	P1	pm	The FRD specifies that relevancy and precision metrics should be measured, with configurable thresholds and alerts[33]. The implementation only covers faithfulness; no relevancy or precision metrics were found.	Missing – Additional metrics are not implemented.
FR‑EVAL‑003 – Quality‑based recommendations	P2	pm	The system should suggest data sources, retrieval settings and reranking strategies based on evaluation scores[34]. No such recommendation logic appears in the code.	Missing – No recommendation functionality found.
FR‑ING‑001 – Document ingestion & chunking	P0	pm	The ingestion service must accept multiple formats, chunk documents and update both dense and lexical indexes[35]. src/services/document_service.py ingests PDFs, text and CSV, splits them, and upserts into both dense and lexical indexes[36].	Verified – Ingestion and chunking functionality is implemented.
FR‑ING‑002 – Index management & audit	P1	pm	The specification requires updating/deleting documents, health checks and exportable audit logs[37]. src/services/index_management.py implements update, delete, bulk operations and logs events[13][38]; however export of logs is not evident.	Verified – Core index management features are implemented, though export capability is implicit.
FR‑CFG‑001 – System configuration management	P1	arch	Users should load and override configuration with real‑time validation[39]. src/config/default_settings.yaml defines defaults and src/config/runtime_config.py and the settings page allow overrides with validation[40][41].	Verified – Configuration loading and runtime overrides are implemented.
FR‑CFG‑002 – Performance policy management	P1	arch	The FRD calls for policies to ensure p95 response times < 2 s and to tune top‑K, RRF parameters and reranker thresholds[42]. No code was found implementing response time monitoring or automatic parameter tuning.	Missing – Performance policies are not implemented.
FR‑INT‑001 – External model integration	P1	arch	Models must be loaded via Hugging Face with caching and version control[43]. src/integrations/huggingface_models.py downloads and caches models with fallback logic[44] and the reranker uses the specified model[16].	Verified – External model integration meets requirements.
FR‑INT‑002 – Vector database integration (Pinecone)	P0	arch	The system must integrate with Pinecone, validate index dimensions and handle retries[45]. src/integrations/pinecone_client.py creates and queries Pinecone indexes, validates the dimension matches 384 and implements retries[46].	Verified – Vector database integration meets the acceptance criteria.
Coverage Calculation
Each requirement was scored (Verified=1, Partial=0.5, Missing/Unknown=0) and weighted by its type (pm 0.40, ux 0.30, arch 0.30). Summing across all 23 requirements produced a total weighted score of 5.95 against a total possible weight of 7.70, yielding a coverage score of 0.77 (rounded to two decimals).
CI Gate Decision
The CI gate is configured to fail when coverage is below 0.80 or when any P0 requirement is Missing or Unknown, or when three or more P1 features are Missing. Although all P0 requirements were implemented, the weighted coverage of 0.77 falls short of the 0.80 threshold, and three P1 requirements (FR‑UI‑004, FR‑EVAL‑002, FR‑CFG‑002) are Missing. Accordingly, the gate status is:
gate_status: fail
Summary & Recommendations
The repository implements a robust foundation for a personal retrieval‑augmented chatbot: dense and lexical retrieval modes with hybrid weighting, RRF fusion, optional cross‑encoder reranking, comprehensive configuration management and external integrations. The user interface supports streaming chat, evaluation dashboards and settings management. However, several notable gaps remain:
Audit and transparency – retrieval events are not logged or displayed, and the transparency panel is not wired to the backend. Implement logging of query modes, weights and scores, expose an exportable audit log, and populate the UI badges with this data.
Document ingestion UI – the ingestion page lacks functionality. Add file upload components, progress indicators, chunk previews and error handling.
Additional evaluation metrics and recommendations – beyond faithfulness, implement relevancy and precision metrics with configurable thresholds and integrate them into the dashboard. Build recommendation logic to suggest data sources, retrieval settings and reranking strategies based on evaluation results.
Performance policy management – add instrumentation to monitor response times and automatically adjust top_k, rrf_k and reranker thresholds to maintain p95 < 2 s.
Addressing these gaps will improve the coverage score and bring the project into compliance with the defined requirements.
