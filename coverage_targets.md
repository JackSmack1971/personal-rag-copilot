# Identify coverage gaps
uncovered_lines = []
for module in coverage_data:
    for line in module.lines:
        if not line.covered and not line.excluded:
            uncovered_lines.append({
                'file': module.filename,
                'line': line.number,
                'context': line.context
            })
```

#### Risk Assessment
```python
# Assess gap risk
def assess_gap_risk(gap):
    risk_factors = {
        'critical_path': gap.in_critical_path(),
        'error_prone': gap.has_complex_logic(),
        'user_facing': gap.affects_ui(),
        'dependency': gap.uses_external_libs()
    }
    return sum(risk_factors.values())
